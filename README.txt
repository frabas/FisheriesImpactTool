The tool workflow (see diagram) is designed to answer the question about how much fishing pressure affects 
the benthic habitats and communities (MSFD Descriptor 6) 
and the commercially-important fish and shellfish exploited in the area (in line with MSFD Descriptor 3) 
by quantifying the spatial distribution of the fishing pressure
and removals of fish from the fisheries.
The tool itself is a set of R routines.  
A specific github repository hosting the tool online, and which further offers a way to control the versions 
of the tool when amended (the github platform is an online service for versioning control system).
