# ICES 2017 HELCOM Technical Service for the production of spatial data layers of fishing intensity/pressure

There are two types of files stored in this folder: 
* ESRI Shapefile datasets (e.g. HELCOM_intensity_<gear_code>_<year>.shp) 
* Plots of surface and subsurface abrasion for 2016 (e.g. HELCOM_intensity_<gear_code>_2016.png). 

The code used to create the data products is available here: https://github.com/ices-eg/wg_WGSFD

The contained datasets are subject to the ICES Data Policy http://ices.dk/marine-data/guidelines-and-policy/Pages/ICES-data-policy.aspx
