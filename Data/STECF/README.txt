Please find below the public links to the STECF database where you can find relevant information on fishing activities at best at the ICES rectangle resolution (ICES WG will only have this info at the subdivision SD scale to our knowledge, while STECF and ICES databases might not be consistent after all):

You need to go to this site
https://datacollection.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dd/effort/maps

This has a table of effort by rectangle and quarter and another of landings by rectangle and quarter.

The other web page
https://datacollection.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dd/effort/tables

These tables only deal with annual information. For landings and discards the STECF FDI chair took the decision not to show discards by quarter as there are concerns raised about the appropriateness of the discards data at such a level of disaggregation even as annual figures.

Extraction of data from there is a little bit tricky and for example you´ll need to expand the table by clicking on it (the row headings) before downloading the data to get the right level of aggregation you want in outcomes.

You should also be aware that these data was primarily collected to inform the Effort EU Regulation and associated plans (described in Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 for cod in the Baltic; Annex II in REGULATION  (EC) NO 43/2009 in other areas, etc.) then it is arranged by regulated areas and gears, e.g. Annex BAL corresponds to the Baltic (excluding Kattegat) while Kattegat is the Annex IIA Reg area 3A… Anyway all effort and landings should be there for the Baltic i.e. for regulated plus non-regulated gears….

So as there are some pitfalls, best is to refer to the report when something is unclear:
